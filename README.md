1.	Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure the deadlines are met.
-Timely delivery ensures customer satisfaction-ensures that stakeholders and clients
receive the product in time.
-Cost management –delays often lead to increased costs due to extended development time.
>effective time and resource management, proper planning ensures the product is delivered on time.
2.	How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Importance of effective cost control
-Prevents unexpected expenses, that could derail the project.
 -improves resource allocation>Ensures that funds are allocated to high-priority tasks such as development testing, and infrastructure
Strategies to prevent budget overruns
-Accurate and realistic budget estimation
-Effective resource planning 
-Continuous monitoring and tracking
-Post project review and learning
3.	Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each.
Differences.
-Agile allows for changes while waterfall follows a fixed plan
-Agile delivers work in small increments, whereas Waterfall delivers the entire product at the end .
-Agile requires   ongoing  feedback, while waterfall requires minimal client involvement.
Similarities.
-Both aim to deliver a high quality product efficiently.
-Both require planning ,execution , and review to ensure project success.
-Both methodologies use structured workflows  to guide development.
Advantages of agile
-Allows for changes in requirements , making it ideal for dynamic projects.
-Early issue detection .
-Improved quality due to regular testing.
Disadvantages of agile.
-Not suitable for all projects.
-Can be resource-intensive as it requires continuous collaborations and frequent meetings.
-Difficult to predict costs.
Advantages of  waterfall.
-Clear structure and organization.
-Easier to manage large teams 
-easier cost and time estimation since the scope is scoped from the beginning.
Disadvantages of waterfall
-Inflexibility to changes.
-high risk of project failure
4.  In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile.
-Software development with changing requirements  .e.g. startups ,web applications SaaS platforms. 
-Projects with high uncertainty .e.g. R&D software.
Waterfall.
-Projects with fixed requirements and scope .e.g. Government contracts ,legal compliance system .E.T.C. . 
5.	What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
    methods
-Define clear quality standards and objectives.
-Conduct regular code reviews and peer inspections.
-Use test automation for efficiency.
Importance
-Ensures software reliability and performance.
-Enhances user satisfaction and experience.
-Boosts security and protects data.
6.	How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Contribution.
-Provides clear objectives and goals.
-Helps in accurate budgeting and resource allocation.
-Reduces scope creep.
                -Work breakdown structure(WBS)>-this is a hierarchical decomposition of a project into smaller , manageable tasks.
            Importance of WBS.
             -Improves project planning –Clearly defines all  necessary tasks.
            -improves team collaboration-Everyone understands their notes.
             -aids cost estimation and budgeting –Breaks down costs at each level
7.	What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Benefits.
-Improves time management.
-Enhances resource allocation.
-Reduces project risks.
How gantt charts assist in this process.
-Visualizes the entire project timeline.
-Defines task dependencies
-Enhances time management and deadline tracking.
8.	What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
-Inefficiency and time wastage
-poor communication and collaboration .
>Businesses lose productivity when employees spend too much time  on manual tasks .
9.	How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution.
-Improves focus and efficiency as one is able to focus on the known problem.
-ensures alignment  with user needs>avoids unnecessary features that add complexity with value.
10.	How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
The software solution should be a bridge between the identified problem and the necessary solution.
11.	What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
12.	What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
13.	How can understanding market trends inform your software’s positioning and development
